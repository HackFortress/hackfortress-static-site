    <h2>What is Hackfortress?</h2>
    <section>
      <p>
        Teams of 10 (4 Hackers + 6 TF2 players) will compete to score more points than their opponents during 
        each match. The goal is simple: score more points than your competitors. How you do that is where the 
        challenge comes in. The TF2 players will be frantically trying to kill, capture and win rounds against the 
        opposing TF2 players. At the same time, the hackers will be attempting to solve a variety of hacking 
        challenges. As tasks are completed, credits in our ‘hackconomy’ are gained. These can be used to purchase 
        effects to help your team or hinder your opponents in both hacking and TF2.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tournament will start at 10:00 am on Saturday. If you win all of your matches, you’ll play a max of 3 
        rounds (with a 45 minute finale).
